## <small>Some 'crude' facts about inequality</small>
- The richest **1% of the** population is **wealthier than the rest of the world combined**.

- In 2010, **388 individuals** had the same wealth as 3.6 billion people.

- In 2015, this share of population further narrowed to **62 people**.

- In the last 15 years, the **average annual income of the poorest 10%** of people in the world has **risen by less than a single dollar cent per year**.

## <small>Economic growth triggers inequality</small>
- Inverted U hypothesis 
    + the concentration of savings in the hands of the upper social classes 
    + the rise in the urban share of the population

## <small>Inequality hampers economic growth</small>
- Political instability;
- rent-seeking activities threatening property rights;
- reduced investment in education;

## <small>Rational choice theory</small>

- **preferences, constraints and prices** affect consumers' choice
- Indivuduals are rational and use **information** to determine which options are available, rank them and choose the most preferred one
- goods posses **inherent and unique** characteristics
- utility maximisation is a matter of **arranging spending to to achieve the highest total utility**

## <small>Behavioural economics</small>

- **Cognitive, social and emotional variables** influence consumers' choice.

## <small>Inequality and consumption behaviour</small> 

Consumption behaviour differs according to social status

## <small>Research question</small>

**How the rise in inequality, economic growth and usage of public transportation influences the purchase of cars (as an example of luxury good) in Singapore, from 1995 to 2014**.

## <small>The case study</small>

A successful developing economy...

## <small>The case study</small>

... With a world class transportation system and policies deterring the purchase of private cars

![](Images_presentation/SingaporeTransitMap.jpg)

## <small>Hypotheses</small>

- *H1:* The higher the economic growth, the higher the purchase of luxury cars

- *H2:* The higher the inequality, the higher the purchase of luxury cars

- *H3:* The less usage of public transport, the higher the purchase of luxury cars

# <small>Dependent variable</small>
Number of privately owned cars
