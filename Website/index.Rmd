<center><h2>What the project is about</h2></center>
<br>

The research tries to find out why people living in Singapore buy cars. Currently 11% of people living in Singapore own a car. However, Singapore can't afford high rates of car ownership. Today the island has **5,4 million people**, **3426 kilometers of road lenght**, and **810339 vehicles**, including buses, rental cars, taxis and private cars, the latter represent **75%** of all the vehicles population. To **clog** all the roads of Singapore, it would be needed **1918660 more cars**. Let us show it in a diferent way; **if 35% of the Singaporeans would own a car** then it **wouldn't be ebough space** in the road to drive or to transport by public buses the remamining 65% of teh population. **Only 24% more of car ownership could literally paralize the roads.**^[Own calculations based on "Key Transport Statistics of World Cities" that can be found [here](http://www.lta.gov.sg/ltaacademy/doc/13Sep105-Pan_KeyTransportStatistics.pdf) and data used for the analysis and cited afterwards] 

The problem is not limited to space. It extends to gas emissions, the right to commute of those lacking a car, and the paradigm of car ownership as a symbol of success and status. Hence, we tried to find out the motivations for buying cars.
<br>
<center><h2>Why Singapore and why cars?</h2></center>
<br>

- Nation state. It is a country and a city at the same time. Interesting for urban policies
- High density. 5,5 million people living in 700 square Kilometers, roughly. No room for many cars^[See more populations statistics in the Sinagporan annual report about population trends [here](http://www.singstat.gov.sg/publications/publications-and-papers/population-and-population-structure/population-trends)]
- Rich society. for the last 20 years, has been ranked in the 10% richest countries in terms of GDP per capita^[Own calculations based on the data base of historical countries' GDP per capita provided by the World Bank. Find the information [here](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD/countries?display=default)]. Therefore, more money , more consumption?
- Meritocracy is one of the bases of the Singaporean model ^[ A brief description of the meritocratic approach can be found [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/04/16/how-singapore-is-fixing-its-meritocracy/)]. In this, some wins and other loose. Those who win may need to show a symbol: luxury cars? and those who loose may want to have the symbol as weel[@JohanssonStenman:2006jw;@Xu:2006wa].  
- Meritocracy is uneqaual in essence, so is income distribution in Singapore. In the last 20 years,the gap between the top 10% and the bottom 90% earners broadened from 4 to 8 times. 
- It has a world class public transportation system, but still people buy cars
- Singapore is trying to change the paradigm of car ownership: Driverless cars[@Ho:2016ul].
- Due to a number a policies, the average cost of a car in Singapore is 5 times higher than in a developed country [@TheStraitsTimes:2014vf]

<center><h2>Some theory about determinants of consumption behaviour</h2></center>
<br>
We believe that the decision of purchasing a car can be motivated by **rational** impulses, deeply understanding all upsides and downsides of the alternatives, but also driven by **non rational** causes, ego for example. The firts set of causes belong to the standard rational choice model whereas the second to behavioral economics.

- **Consumption under the rational choice lens**
    + Consumers want to maximize the utility of the good or service to be purchased or consumed [@levin2004introduction]
    + Identical and quasi identical goods provide the same utility. For example, two Volkswagen Golf of the same year should privide the same utility regardless of one being red and the other being black 
    + The more disposable income the more propensity to consume
    + Consumers rank the utilities of all the alternatives and choose the one that provides the highest [@mont2013understanding]
    + Consumers have access to all the information needed  to decide what to consume
<br>
<br>
- **Consumption under the behavioral economics lens** 
    + The good to be consumed has characteristics and these have different utilities. For example, a red Volkswagen with leather seats could have a differet utility than a black one with regular fabric seats [@Lancaster:1966kf]
    + Consumption is affected by what society considers to be fair (social norms). Having big cars in some societies is considered to be pretentious and environmentaly unfriendly [@DepartmentforTransport:2011ui]  
    + People tend to consume what others consume, even if that is rationally wrong. This is because people follow reference points when deciding [@Wilkinson2012] 
    + People can exteriorize their ego through consumming certain goods [@DepartmentforTransport:2011ui]

<h2>Then we build our statistical model</h2>
</center>
<center><h3>...we want to know if:</h3></center>
<center><h3>the purchase of new cars depends on GDP per capita, income inequality,use of public transport and population of cars</h3></center>
<br>
<center><h3>...So, we have the following hypothesis and assumptions:</h3></center>

| Hypothesis | Assumption | 
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------
| The higher the economic growth in the current year and in the previous year, the higher the purchase of cars in the present year; therefore increasing the ratio of cars per inhabitants  | Economic growth increases disposable income, reduces budgetary constraint. People save money to spend in the future but also they may save in the first semester and spend it in the secod of the same year 
| The higher the inequality, the higher the purchase of cars | The emerging and consolidated social classes need to set reference points displaying their status, by buying cars (symbols) 
| The less usage of public transport, the higher the purchase of cars | Despite the density of public transportantion modes, commuters choose cars by incentives not explained by the rational choice standard model (ego, social norms,etc) 
| The larger the car population of the previous year, the higher the purchase of cars in the present year | The average social reference point is having a car, that is the threshold to reach. People decide based on past experiences, in this case if people had cars or not the previous year. 

The results of the model are shown in the following table, where our expectations on the impact of the explanatory variables are compared with the actual influence emerged from our analyses ("+"" stands for a positive influence, "-" indicates a negative impact, "0" indicates that the varible was not significant).

| Variable | Expected result | Empirical result |
| ----------------------| ------------- | ------------- 
| Lagged number of cars | + | + 
| GDP per capita | + | 0 
| Lagged GDP per capita | + | 0 
| Lagged top 10% average income | + | 0 
| Lagged Bottom 10% average income | + | 0 
| Average daily utilization of buses per 100 people | - | 0 
| Average daily utilization of MRT per 100 people | - | - 
| Average daily utilization of LRT per 100 people | - | + 

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

- Some hypotheses were right: 
    + People living in Singapore buy cars just because other people own cars. This supports behavioral economics theory  

    + Now 11% of the people of Singapore owns a car. The only presence of caars increases the purchase of cars in 1% for every hundred people. For example, if today 11% of the population has cars this trigerrs 1% of the ppopulation to bur cars, rising the ratio to 12% of the population with car owbership. This 12% again triggers a new increase and so on.
    
    . The new population of cars would again push to buy more cars and so fort. 
    + The more people using MRT the less purchase of cars. This supports rational choice theory. However, the usage of MRT should triplicate in order to reduce the purchase of cars in only 7%.
    
- Some hypotheses were wrong:
    + People buy more cars if they use more LRT. It should be the opposite. 
    
- Some do not affect the model at levels we can trust:
    + The higher the income the more cars people buy 
    + The higher the GDP per capita the higher the population of cars
    + The more usage of public buses the less purchase or cars
    + The research could improve if more data were available. The results are affected by the low number of observations
